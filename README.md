A file comparison tool

![DirCompEA](screens.png?raw=true "DirCompEA ~ A file comparison tool")

## Description

This is an old project of mine that I created when I was backing up my old laptop in 2008. It calculates HASH values of files in folders you choose and shows differences..

## Usage

* Select directories using "..." button, or enter full path name to the text box that you want to compare. 
*  Click "Compare" button at the bottom.

After the comparison, the select box will fill out and you can change the sub directories from there. Left and right views will syncronize.
